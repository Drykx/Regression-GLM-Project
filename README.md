# Regression-Methods

## Introduction

For the course `Math-408` as a team of two, we had to do [Project](src/Project2023.pdf).

## Github Organisation

You can find the [final Report](src/Projet.pdf) and the [R markdown compile](src/Notebook.Rmd) file, who needs the file [helper file](helpers.R) to compile.
